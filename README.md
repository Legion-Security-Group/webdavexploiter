# webdavexploiter
Legion Group's WebDav vulnerablity exploiter based on Python.

This is pretty fast, and we have included some vulnerable sites (2020) in the list.txt file. Do NOT rename list.txt, because the script exports the websites to exploit from the list.txt file. All results of this tool will be in the "result.txt" text-file.

### Compability ###

This project should support all Linux distributions that have a working Python installed. Windows 7, 8.1 and 10 have NOT worked in our tests, but feel free to try it. Feel free to fork this repository and remake a Windows compatible version if you wish. We personally recommend Kali, ParrotSecurity, normal debian, lubuntu, Arch or Manjaro.
